#  BigTime Casino is not registered with Gamstop - players advised to avoid!

Gamstop is a UK based self-exclusion scheme for gambling, which is intended to help problem gamblers by restricting their access to gambling websites and services. It's a free and voluntary service that allows problem gamblers to exclude themselves from all online gambling, including casinos, sports betting, poker and bingo websites.

Since its inception in 2014, Gamstop has seen over 50,000 registrations from people who want to protect themselves from the dangers of gambling addiction. The scheme is fully endorsed by the UK Gambling Commission and has the backing of most of the leading online casinos and bookmakers.

So it came as a surprise to us when we discovered that BigTime Casino was not registered with Gamstop. This means that players at BigTime Casino are not protected by the Gamstop scheme and are at risk of developing a gambling addiction.

We therefore advise players NOT to sign up at BigTime Casino or any other casino that is not registered with Gamstop.

#  Online casino industry leader BigTime Casino refuses to sign up with Gamstop

BigTime Casino, one of the industry leaders in online casino gaming, has announced that it will not sign up with Gamstop. The company issued a statement saying that it "does not believe that the Gamstop solution is in the best interests of our customers or our business."

Gamstop is a British program that is designed to help problem gamblers. It is a self-exclusion program that allows people to ban themselves from all gambling sites. Players who sign up for Gamstop are required to provide personal information, including their name, address, and date of birth.

BigTime Casino's refusal to join Gamstop has stirred up a lot of controversy. Some people argue that the program is necessary in order to protect problem gamblers. Others claim that Gamstop is a way for the government to control the online casino industry.

BigTime Casino has defended its decision, saying that it already has measures in place to protect its customers. The company says that it does not want to share its customers' personal information with the government. It also argues that Gamstop is not an effective solution, and that many people will simply find ways around the program.

#  Is BigTime Casino's refusal to join Gamstop a bad sign for online gamers?

On Tuesday 2nd of October, BigTime Casino became the latest online casino to refuse to join Gamstop - a UK government-backed scheme designed to protect online gamblers. The move has raised eyebrows among the online gaming community, with some people fearing that it could be a bad sign for the future of online gaming.

Gamstop is a voluntary scheme that allows online gamblers to self-exclude from every gambling site in the UK. It was set up in April 2018 in response to the increase in online gambling, and is backed by the UK government as well as several major online casinos.

So far, over 150 casinos have signed up to Gamstop, including all of the major operators such as Bet365, Ladbrokes, and William Hill. However, a number of smaller casinos have refused to join, including BigTime Casino and Casino.com.

BigTime Casino's refusal to join Gamstop has caused some concern among gamers, who fear that it could be a sign that the industry is starting to collapse. Online casinos are facing increasing competition from illegal betting sites, and many believe that the industry is starting to crumble.

The CEO of BigTime Casino has defended the decision not to join Gamstop, stating that the casino already has strict measures in place to protect its customers. He also said that joining Gamstop would be "pointless" given that BigTime Casino already operates within British law.

Despite these assurances, some gamers remain concerned about the future of online gaming. With more and more casinos refusing to join Gamstop, it seems likely that this voluntary scheme will start to fall apart - leaving online gamers unprotected against fraudulent operators.

#  What is the reason behind BigTime Casino's decision not to sign up with Gamstop?

BigTime Casino has announced that it will not be signing up with Gamstop, the UK-based self-exclusion scheme for online gambling. The decision has caused some controversy, as Gamstop is backed by the government and is seen as a key tool in helping to prevent problem gambling.

So why has BigTime Casino decided not to join Gamstop? There are a few possible reasons. Firstly, the casino may feel that the scheme is not effective or efficient enough. Secondly, there may be concerns over data protection and how user information will be shared and used. And finally, there could be worries that Gamstop could eventually become a monopoly in the online gambling market, with all of the major operators signing up to it.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that BigTime Casino has decided not to join Gamstop and will continue to operate independently. This could cause some problems for the casino, as it could be seen as being less responsible when it comes to protecting its players from problem gambling. However, it's important to note that BigTime Casino already has a number of measures in place to protect its customers, such as age verification and responsible gambling messages. So while it may not be joining Gamstop, BigTime Casino is still taking steps to ensure responsible gambling practices.

#  Could this be the end of BigTime Casino as we know it?

The casino industry is a booming one, with an estimated global value of over $45 billion. It is no wonder, then, that online casinos are becoming ever more popular. In particular, BigTime Casino has been a favorite among players for years.

However, recent reports suggest that BigTime Casino may be on the brink of closure. This news comes as a huge shock to the gaming community and has left many players wondering what will become of their favorite site.

At this point, it is unclear what the future holds for BigTime Casino. The company has yet to release an official statement regarding the closure rumors. However, if the reports are true, it is likely that the site will shut down permanently in the very near future.

This would be a huge loss for the online casino industry, as well as for players around the world who have enjoyed spending time at BigTime Casino. The site has always been known for its generous bonuses and its wide variety of games. It would be a shame to see it go.
