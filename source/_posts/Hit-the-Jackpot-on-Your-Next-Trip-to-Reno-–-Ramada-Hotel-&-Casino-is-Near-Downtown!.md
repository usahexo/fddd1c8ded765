#  Enjoy Royal Treatment with Blackjack Royal Pairs Game at Ramada

Blackjack is perhaps one of the most popular casino table games that offer players a great chance to beat the dealer and win big. The variants of blackjack can make the game more exciting, including the Royal Pairs variant where players can enjoy special payouts for hands that include two queens, two kings, or two aces. When playing this game at Ramada Casino Hotel, visitors can enjoy an exclusive royal treatment.

The croupiers are professional and friendly, and they will be happy to teach beginners the basics of the game. The table limits are suitable for all budgets, so anyone can afford to try their luck at blackjack.

Royal Pairs is a thrilling variation of blackjack that offers players the chance to win big payouts for hands that include two queens, kings, or aces. In this game, the Dealer must draw cards until he reaches 16 points or less. If he busts (goes over 21 points), then all players who have not busted automatically win. If the Dealer has 16 points or less, any player with a hand total of 17 points or more automatically loses (even if their hand includes two queens, kings, or aces).

In Royal Pairs blackjack, each card is worth its face value with the exception of 10s and court cards (jacks, queens, and kings). These cards are each worth 10 points apiece in this game. This makes it important for players to remember which cards have already been played because they may want to hold onto high-value cards like queens and kings in order to form pairs.
