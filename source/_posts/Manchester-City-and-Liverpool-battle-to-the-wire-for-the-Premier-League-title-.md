#  Manchester City and Liverpool battle to the wire for the Premier League title 

Manchester City and Liverpool are in a tight battle for the Premier League title. The two teams are neck-and-neck on points, with each having one remaining game to play. Manchester City currently has the advantage due to their superior goal differential.

Liverpool came into the season as the favorites to win the league. They were coming off of a Champions League final appearance and had made several big acquisitions in the offseason. However, Manchester City has been the surprise team this year. They have been dominant in the Premier League, thanks largely to their prolific offense.

The final game of the season is between Manchester City and Brighton. If Manchester City wins, they will be crowned champions. If Liverpool wins, they will need to hope that Manchester City loses their final game against Southampton in order to claim the title.

This title race has been one of the most exciting in recent memory. Both teams have played some scintillating soccer and neither one seems willing to give up easily. The supporters of both clubs are certainly hoping for a dramatic finish on the last day of the season.

#  Arsenal finally end their long trophy drought  

Arsenal secured their first trophy in nine years after they came from behind to defeat Chelsea 2-1 in the fa cup final. The Gunners were 1-0 down at halftime after Diego Costa’s strike, but goals from Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey saw them crowned champions.

Arsenal have been through a difficult period in recent years, with several seasons without any silverware. This victory will go a long way to restoring belief among the club’s supporters that they can compete for major trophies once again.

Arsene Wenger has been under pressure to deliver success in recent years, but this victory will ease some of the pressure on him. The Frenchman has been with Arsenal for over 20 years, and this win is sure to cement his legacy at the club.

Chelsea had chances to extend their lead in the second half, but Petr Cech was in excellent form and kept Arsenal in the game. The Czech goalkeeper made a number of impressive saves, and was finally rewarded with a winners medal late on.

This was an excellent all-round performance from Arsenal, and they fully deserved to come out on top. They showed great character to come back from behind, and will be hoping to build on this success in the coming years.

#  Manchester United appoint a new manager and make a strong comeback in the league 

Manchester United appointed Ole Gunnar Solksjaer as their new manager on March 28, 2019. The Norwegian has a fantastic record at the club as a player and coach, and United fans are optimistic about his appointment. Solskjaer’s first game in charge was an away match against Cardiff City, which United won 2-0. This was followed by a 5-1 victory over Huddersfield Town, with new signing Daniel James scoring on his debut. 

Since then, Manchester United have continued to pick up positive results, including a 3-1 win away at Crystal Palace. This puts them back in contention for a top-four finish in the Premier League, and they are now only two points behind fourth place Tottenham Hotspur. There is also still the chance of Champions League qualification via the Europa League, with United currently in second place in their group. 

One of the main reasons for Manchester United’s improvement under Solskjaer has been the return to form of Paul Pogba. The Frenchman has been one of the best players in the Premier League this season, and played a crucial role in United’s victories over Huddersfield Town and Cardiff City. Pogba was recently named captain of France for their upcoming games against Iceland and Turkey, and he will be hoping to lead his country to glory in the World Cup this summer. 

Despite their recent good form, there are still some concerns about Manchester United. One major issue is their defence, which has been poor throughout the season. Another worry is that Marcus Rashford has not been scoring goals regularly lately, although he did score in the 3-1 win over Crystal Palace. 

Overall, though, things are looking much brighter for Manchester United since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took over as manager. If he can continue this good run of form until the end of the season, then there is no reason why they cannot qualify for Champions League football next year.

#  Spurs prove they are no one-season wonders as they secure a Champions League spot 

After topping a group that included Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur have secured their place in the Champions League for the second successive season. They join fellow English sides Liverpool and Manchester City in Europe’s top club competition.

Many had written Spurs off at the start of the season after they finished third in last year’s Premier League. However, under the guidance of Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs have shown that they are no one-season wonders.

Their victory against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final was their 10th consecutive win at Wembley Stadium and showed that they are not just a team that can beat the big boys, but can also beat the best teams in England.

Harry Kane has been in superb form this season, scoring 27 goals in all competitions, and he will be looking to add to his tally of five Champions League goals in this year’s competition.

With key players such as Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen also contributing to Tottenham’s success, Spurs will be confident of progressing through their Champions League group, which includes Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.

#  Chelsea suffer a disappointing campaign and miss out on Champions League football

Chelsea missed out on Champions League football yet again after a disappointing campaign.

The Blues started the season poorly, with manager Antonio Conte struggling to get his side firing on all cylinders. They were knocked out of the League Cup early on, and in January they slumped to a 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, which left them just four points above the relegation zone.

In the end, they finished in fifth place in the Premier League, which meant that they would not be competing in Europe’s top club competition next season. This was a major disappointment for Chelsea fans, who are used to seeing their team competing at the highest level.

One of the main reasons for Chelsea’s struggles this season was their lack of firepower up front. Striker Alvaro Morata had an inconsistent campaign, scoring just 11 goals in all competitions. And with Eden Hazard also having a below-par season, Chelsea lacked a genuine goal threat.

There were also reports of disharmony between Conte and some of Chelsea’s players, which likely didn’t help matters.

Now it remains to be seen whether Conte will remain in charge at Stamford Bridge next season or whether he will be replaced by another manager.
