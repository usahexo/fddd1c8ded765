This statement was released in response to growing concerns that Weinstein’s casinos may be using off-the-books black chips.</p>
<p>Weinstein stated: “I want to make it perfectly clear that my casinos are using only white chips. I would never use black chips because they are illegal and could get me in trouble with the authorities.”</p>
<p>When asked how he could be sure that his casinos were using only white chips, Weinstein responded: “I have a team of experts who are closely monitoring the chip distribution at all of my casinos. We are confident that we are using only white chips.”</p>
<p>Weinstein also said that he would be willing to undergo a polygraph test to prove that his casinos are using only white chips.</p>
<h1 id="Harveys-Starts-a-Twitter-Hashtag-Campaign-to-Get-Customers-to-Vote-on-the-Color-of-their-Casino-Chips"><a href="#Harveys-Starts-a-Twitter-Hashtag-Campaign-to-Get-Customers-to-Vote-on-the-Color-of-their-Casino-Chips" class="headerlink" title="Harveys Starts a Twitter Hashtag Campaign to Get Customers to Vote on the Color of their Casino Chips"></a>Harveys Starts a Twitter Hashtag Campaign to Get Customers to Vote on the Color of their Casino Chips</h1><p>In October of 2018, Harveys Casino Resort launched a Twitter hashtag campaign in order to allow their customers to vote on the color of their casino chips. The campaign was met with mixed reactions from social media users.</p>
<p>Some people felt that the campaign was a fun way for customers to get involved in the casino, while others criticized the resort for not including more colors in the voting options. Ultimately, the blue chips were chosen as the new color for Harveys Casino Resort.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Harveys has used social media to engage with their customers. In previous campaigns, the resort has asked customers to choose between different types of burgers and pool floats.</p>
<p>The goal of these campaigns is to create a sense of connection between the resort and its customers. By giving them a voice and allowing them to participate in decisions that affect the casino, Harveys is able to create a stronger bond with its customers.</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing, it’s important to find new and innovative ways to reach your target audience. Traditional methods such as TV ads and billboards are no longer as effective as they once were.</p>
<p>Social media is a powerful tool that can be used to connect with customers on a personal level. It allows businesses to communicate directly with their customers and get feedback on their products and services.</p>
<p>Harveys Casino Resort understands this and has leveraged social media platforms such as Twitter to engage with their customers in fun and unique ways.</p>

The new chips are available at all Harveys locations in the Las Vegas area.</p>
<p>“Our new poker chips are a great way for customers to show their favorite colors and support their favorite casino,” said Jerry, spokesperson for Harveys. “We’re sure that our customers will love these new chips.”</p>
<p>The new poker chips are available in six different colors: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, and purple. Customers can choose any two colors to have printed on their chips.</p>
<p>In addition to the new poker chips, Harveys is also offering a special promotion on Monday. Customers who purchase $10 worth of chips will receive an additional $10 worth of free chips.</p>

<p>“We wanted to do something to encourage people to vote,” said Barbara Gordon, spokesperson for Harveys Casino. “We hope that by offering free buffets, more people will head to the polls.”</p>
<p>The promotion is valid at all Harveys locations in Nevada. Voting will take place from October 22nd through November 2nd.</p>

The change has been long in the making, but was finally announced yesterday by the casino’s parent company, MGM Resorts International."></a>After more than 25 years of using their iconic red, white and blue casino chips, Harveys Casino has revealed a new logo. The change has been long in the making, but was finally announced yesterday by the casino’s parent company, MGM Resorts International.</h2><p>The new logo is meant to evoke a “contemporary and cutting-edge style” for the casino. It retains much of the same look and feel as the old one, but with a more modern design. The blue has also been lightened from a royal blue to a sky blue.</p>
<p>As for the casino chips, they will continue to be red, white and blue. However, the designs on each side of the chip have been updated. The main design on one side is now a simple shield with Harveys written across it in a modern font. The other side features a stylized image of Lake Tahoe in front of the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>
<p>Some have criticized the redesign, saying that it doesn’t evoke the classic style that Harveys is known for. However, many others have praised it as a much-needed update to an aging brand. In any case, it will be interesting to see how Harveys’ new look impacts their business going forward.</p>
