        <h1 id="Manchester-United-to-Kick-Off-2017-18-Season-Without-Wayne-Rooney"><a href="#Manchester-United-to-Kick-Off-2017-18-Season-Without-Wayne-Rooney" class="headerlink" title="Manchester United to Kick Off 2017-18 Season Without Wayne Rooney"></a>Manchester United to Kick Off 2017-18 Season Without Wayne Rooney</h1><p>Manchester United will open their 2017-18 season without star striker Wayne Rooney. The England international has been told he is not in manager Jose Mourinho’s plans and is free to leave the club this summer.</p>
<p>Despite being the club’s all-time top scorer, Rooney’s time at Old Trafford appears to be coming to an end. He is now in the final year of his contract and looks certain to leave Manchester United.</p>
<p>Rooney has been linked with moves to both Everton and MLS side DC United, but no deal has yet been agreed. The 31-year-old is likely to find himself a bit-part player at best next season, so a move away from Manchester United makes sense for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Mourinho has already brought in midfielder Nemanja Matic from Chelsea and winger Romelu Lukaku from Everton this summer, so he clearly doesn’t see Rooney as part of his plans for the new season.</p>
<p>United have been busy in the transfer market this summer and look poised for a title challenge this season. They will start their campaign against West Ham United on Sunday without their all-time top scorer.</p>
<h1 id="Jose-Mourinho-Declares-Manchester-United-a-Little-Horse-in-Premier-League-Race"><a href="#Jose-Mourinho-Declares-Manchester-United-a-Little-Horse-in-Premier-League-Race" class="headerlink" title="José Mourinho Declares Manchester United a Little Horse in Premier League Race"></a>José Mourinho Declares Manchester United a Little Horse in Premier League Race</h1><p>José Mourinho has all but conceded the Premier League title to Pep Guardiola and Manchester City, insisting his Manchester United side are “a little horse that needs milk and needs to learn how to jump.”</p>
<p>United sit 11 points behind the league leaders with only 18 games remaining, and Mourinho says it is now a matter of consolidating their place in the top four.</p>
<p>“The title race is between two horses and a little horse that needs milk and needs to learn how to jump,” he said. “Maybe next season we can be a horse.”</p>
<p>Asked if he felt his side were still in the title race, Mourinho added: “We are in the race for second, third or fourth. I don’t want to say fourth because that’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>Guardiola appeared to take a swipe at his counterpart earlier this week, suggesting some managers are better at spending money than coaching football teams. But Mourinho says he doesn’t care what Guardiola thinks.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in what Pep says, I’m not interested in what he likes,” he said. “I’m interested in what we like.”</p>
<h1 id="PL-Champ-Chelsea-Agree-£60M-Transfer-for-Everton-Star-Romelu-Lukaku"><a href="#PL-Champ-Chelsea-Agree-£60M-Transfer-for-Everton-Star-Romelu-Lukaku" class="headerlink" title="PL Champ Chelsea Agree £60M Transfer for Everton Star Romelu Lukaku"></a>PL Champ Chelsea Agree £60M Transfer for Everton Star Romelu Lukaku</h1><p>Chelsea have agreed a £60 million transfer fee with Everton for striker Romelu Lukaku, according to reports.</p>
<p>The Belgium international is expected to undergo a medical in the next few days and sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>Lukaku, 24, scored 25 goals in all competitions for Everton last season, finishing as the Premier League’s top scorer ahead of Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane.</p>
<p>He joined Everton from Chelsea for £28 million in July 2014 and has scored 68 goals in 151 appearances for the Merseyside club.</p>
<h1 id="Manchester-City-Break-British-Transfer-Record-to-Sign-Bernardo-Silva"><a href="#Manchester-City-Break-British-Transfer-Record-to-Sign-Bernardo-Silva" class="headerlink" title="Manchester City Break British Transfer Record to Sign Bernardo Silva"></a>Manchester City Break British Transfer Record to Sign Bernardo Silva</h1><p>Manchester City have broken their British Transfer Record to sign Bernardo Silva from Monaco for £43million.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the club, and is Pep Guardiola’s first signing of the summer.</p>
<p>Silva is a versatile midfielder who can play in any position in the midfield, and he will be a good addition to the Manchester City squad.</p>
<p>He had an excellent season for Monaco last year, scoring ten goals and providing fourteen assists in all competitions.</p>
<p>Bernardo Silva is a very talented player, and he is sure to be a success in the Premier League.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-Splash-Out-£52M-on-Lyon-Star-Alexandre-Lacazette"><a href="#Arsenal-Splash-Out-£52M-on-Lyon-Star-Alexandre-Lacazette" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal Splash Out £52M on Lyon Star Alexandre Lacazette"></a>Arsenal Splash Out £52M on Lyon Star Alexandre Lacazette</h1><p>Arsenal have completed the signing of Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette in a £52M deal, making him the most expensive player in the club’s history.</p>
<p>Lacazette, 26, has signed a five-year contract at the Emirates and is seen as the long-term replacement for Olivier Giroud up front.</p>
<p>The France international scored over 100 goals in 253 appearances for Lyon and was the top scorer in Ligue 1 last season with 28 goals.</p>
<p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said: “Alexandre is a proven goal scorer and I am confident he will add power and excitement to our team. He has consistently scored goals at the highest level for club and country. We are all looking forward to him joining us on our pre-season tour of Australia later this month.”</p>
<p>Lacazette becomes the latest high-profile addition to Arsenal’s squad this summer following the arrivals of Sead Kolasinac and Alexandre Silva from Schalke 04 and Benfica respectively.</p>
