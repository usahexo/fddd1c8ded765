<p>Royal Pairs is a thrilling variation of blackjack that offers players the chance to win big payouts for hands that include two queens, kings, or aces. In this game, the Dealer must draw cards until he reaches 16 points or less. If he busts (goes over 21 points), then all players who have not busted automatically win. If the Dealer has 16 points or less, any player with a hand total of 17 points or more automatically loses (even if their hand includes two queens, kings, or aces).</p>
<p>In Royal Pairs blackjack, each card is worth its face value with the exception of 10s and court cards (jacks, queens, and kings). These cards are each worth 10 points apiece in this game. This makes it important for players to remember which cards have already been played because they may want to hold onto high-value cards like queens and kings in order to form pairs.</p>
