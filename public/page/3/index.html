<p>Royal Pairs is a thrilling variation of blackjack that offers players the chance to win big payouts for hands that include two queens, kings, or aces. In this game, the Dealer must draw cards until he reaches 16 points or less. If he busts (goes over 21 points), then all players who have not busted automatically win. If the Dealer has 16 points or less, any player with a hand total of 17 points or more automatically loses (even if their hand includes two queens, kings, or aces).</p>
<p>In Royal Pairs blackjack, each card is worth its face value with the exception of 10s and court cards (jacks, queens, and kings). These cards are each worth 10 points apiece in this game. This makes it important for players to remember which cards have already been played because they may want to hold onto high-value cards like queens and kings in order to form pairs.</p>

        <h1 id="BigTime-Casino-is-not-registered-with-Gamstop-players-advised-to-avoid"><a href="#BigTime-Casino-is-not-registered-with-Gamstop-players-advised-to-avoid" class="headerlink" title="BigTime Casino is not registered with Gamstop - players advised to avoid!"></a>BigTime Casino is not registered with Gamstop - players advised to avoid!</h1><p>Gamstop is a UK based self-exclusion scheme for gambling, which is intended to help problem gamblers by restricting their access to gambling websites and services. It’s a free and voluntary service that allows problem gamblers to exclude themselves from all online gambling, including casinos, sports betting, poker and bingo websites.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2014, Gamstop has seen over 50,000 registrations from people who want to protect themselves from the dangers of gambling addiction. The scheme is fully endorsed by the UK Gambling Commission and has the backing of most of the leading online casinos and bookmakers.</p>
<p>So it came as a surprise to us when we discovered that BigTime Casino was not registered with Gamstop. This means that players at BigTime Casino are not protected by the Gamstop scheme and are at risk of developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>We therefore advise players NOT to sign up at BigTime Casino or any other casino that is not registered with Gamstop.</p>
<h1 id="Online-casino-industry-leader-BigTime-Casino-refuses-to-sign-up-with-Gamstop"><a href="#Online-casino-industry-leader-BigTime-Casino-refuses-to-sign-up-with-Gamstop" class="headerlink" title="Online casino industry leader BigTime Casino refuses to sign up with Gamstop"></a>Online casino industry leader BigTime Casino refuses to sign up with Gamstop</h1><p>BigTime Casino, one of the industry leaders in online casino gaming, has announced that it will not sign up with Gamstop. The company issued a statement saying that it “does not believe that the Gamstop solution is in the best interests of our customers or our business.”</p>
<p>Gamstop is a British program that is designed to help problem gamblers. It is a self-exclusion program that allows people to ban themselves from all gambling sites. Players who sign up for Gamstop are required to provide personal information, including their name, address, and date of birth.</p>
<p>BigTime Casino’s refusal to join Gamstop has stirred up a lot of controversy. Some people argue that the program is necessary in order to protect problem gamblers. Others claim that Gamstop is a way for the government to control the online casino industry.</p>
<p>BigTime Casino has defended its decision, saying that it already has measures in place to protect its customers. The company says that it does not want to share its customers’ personal information with the government. It also argues that Gamstop is not an effective solution, and that many people will simply find ways around the program.</p>
<h1 id="Is-BigTime-Casino’s-refusal-to-join-Gamstop-a-bad-sign-for-online-gamers"><a href="#Is-BigTime-Casino’s-refusal-to-join-Gamstop-a-bad-sign-for-online-gamers" class="headerlink" title="Is BigTime Casino’s refusal to join Gamstop a bad sign for online gamers?"></a>Is BigTime Casino’s refusal to join Gamstop a bad sign for online gamers?</h1><p>On Tuesday 2nd of October, BigTime Casino became the latest online casino to refuse to join Gamstop - a UK government-backed scheme designed to protect online gamblers. The move has raised eyebrows among the online gaming community, with some people fearing that it could be a bad sign for the future of online gaming.</p>
<p>Gamstop is a voluntary scheme that allows online gamblers to self-exclude from every gambling site in the UK. It was set up in April 2018 in response to the increase in online gambling, and is backed by the UK government as well as several major online casinos.</p>
<p>So far, over 150 casinos have signed up to Gamstop, including all of the major operators such as Bet365, Ladbrokes, and William Hill. However, a number of smaller casinos have refused to join, including BigTime Casino and Casino.com.</p>
<p>BigTime Casino’s refusal to join Gamstop has caused some concern among gamers, who fear that it could be a sign that the industry is starting to collapse. Online casinos are facing increasing competition from illegal betting sites, and many believe that the industry is starting to crumble.</p>
<p>The CEO of BigTime Casino has defended the decision not to join Gamstop, stating that the casino already has strict measures in place to protect its customers. He also said that joining Gamstop would be “pointless” given that BigTime Casino already operates within British law.</p>
<p>Despite these assurances, some gamers remain concerned about the future of online gaming. With more and more casinos refusing to join Gamstop, it seems likely that this voluntary scheme will start to fall apart - leaving online gamers unprotected against fraudulent operators.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-reason-behind-BigTime-Casino’s-decision-not-to-sign-up-with-Gamstop"><a href="#What-is-the-reason-behind-BigTime-Casino’s-decision-not-to-sign-up-with-Gamstop" class="headerlink" title="What is the reason behind BigTime Casino’s decision not to sign up with Gamstop?"></a>What is the reason behind BigTime Casino’s decision not to sign up with Gamstop?</h1><p>BigTime Casino has announced that it will not be signing up with Gamstop, the UK-based self-exclusion scheme for online gambling. The decision has caused some controversy, as Gamstop is backed by the government and is seen as a key tool in helping to prevent problem gambling.</p>
<p>So why has BigTime Casino decided not to join Gamstop? There are a few possible reasons. Firstly, the casino may feel that the scheme is not effective or efficient enough. Secondly, there may be concerns over data protection and how user information will be shared and used. And finally, there could be worries that Gamstop could eventually become a monopoly in the online gambling market, with all of the major operators signing up to it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that BigTime Casino has decided not to join Gamstop and will continue to operate independently. This could cause some problems for the casino, as it could be seen as being less responsible when it comes to protecting its players from problem gambling. However, it’s important to note that BigTime Casino already has a number of measures in place to protect its customers, such as age verification and responsible gambling messages. So while it may not be joining Gamstop, BigTime Casino is still taking steps to ensure responsible gambling practices.</p>
<h1 id="Could-this-be-the-end-of-BigTime-Casino-as-we-know-it"><a href="#Could-this-be-the-end-of-BigTime-Casino-as-we-know-it" class="headerlink" title="Could this be the end of BigTime Casino as we know it?"></a>Could this be the end of BigTime Casino as we know it?</h1><p>The casino industry is a booming one, with an estimated global value of over $45 billion. It is no wonder, then, that online casinos are becoming ever more popular. In particular, BigTime Casino has been a favorite among players for years.</p>
<p>However, recent reports suggest that BigTime Casino may be on the brink of closure. This news comes as a huge shock to the gaming community and has left many players wondering what will become of their favorite site.</p>
<p>At this point, it is unclear what the future holds for BigTime Casino. The company has yet to release an official statement regarding the closure rumors. However, if the reports are true, it is likely that the site will shut down permanently in the very near future.</p>
<p>This would be a huge loss for the online casino industry, as well as for players around the world who have enjoyed spending time at BigTime Casino. The site has always been known for its generous bonuses and its wide variety of games. It would be a shame to see it go.</p>
<p>Some players are already beginning to look for other online casinos to call their home. But with so many options available, it can be difficult to know which site is right for you. If you’re looking for a new casino to try out, here are four sites that are worth checking out:</p>

        <h1 id="Manchester-United-to-Kick-Off-2017-18-Season-Without-Wayne-Rooney"><a href="#Manchester-United-to-Kick-Off-2017-18-Season-Without-Wayne-Rooney" class="headerlink" title="Manchester United to Kick Off 2017-18 Season Without Wayne Rooney"></a>Manchester United to Kick Off 2017-18 Season Without Wayne Rooney</h1><p>Manchester United will open their 2017-18 season without star striker Wayne Rooney. The England international has been told he is not in manager Jose Mourinho’s plans and is free to leave the club this summer.</p>
<p>Despite being the club’s all-time top scorer, Rooney’s time at Old Trafford appears to be coming to an end. He is now in the final year of his contract and looks certain to leave Manchester United.</p>
<p>Rooney has been linked with moves to both Everton and MLS side DC United, but no deal has yet been agreed. The 31-year-old is likely to find himself a bit-part player at best next season, so a move away from Manchester United makes sense for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Mourinho has already brought in midfielder Nemanja Matic from Chelsea and winger Romelu Lukaku from Everton this summer, so he clearly doesn’t see Rooney as part of his plans for the new season.</p>
<p>United have been busy in the transfer market this summer and look poised for a title challenge this season. They will start their campaign against West Ham United on Sunday without their all-time top scorer.</p>
<h1 id="Jose-Mourinho-Declares-Manchester-United-a-Little-Horse-in-Premier-League-Race"><a href="#Jose-Mourinho-Declares-Manchester-United-a-Little-Horse-in-Premier-League-Race" class="headerlink" title="José Mourinho Declares Manchester United a Little Horse in Premier League Race"></a>José Mourinho Declares Manchester United a Little Horse in Premier League Race</h1><p>José Mourinho has all but conceded the Premier League title to Pep Guardiola and Manchester City, insisting his Manchester United side are “a little horse that needs milk and needs to learn how to jump.”</p>
<p>United sit 11 points behind the league leaders with only 18 games remaining, and Mourinho says it is now a matter of consolidating their place in the top four.</p>
<p>“The title race is between two horses and a little horse that needs milk and needs to learn how to jump,” he said. “Maybe next season we can be a horse.”</p>
<p>Asked if he felt his side were still in the title race, Mourinho added: “We are in the race for second, third or fourth. I don’t want to say fourth because that’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>Guardiola appeared to take a swipe at his counterpart earlier this week, suggesting some managers are better at spending money than coaching football teams. But Mourinho says he doesn’t care what Guardiola thinks.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in what Pep says, I’m not interested in what he likes,” he said. “I’m interested in what we like.”</p>
<h1 id="PL-Champ-Chelsea-Agree-£60M-Transfer-for-Everton-Star-Romelu-Lukaku"><a href="#PL-Champ-Chelsea-Agree-£60M-Transfer-for-Everton-Star-Romelu-Lukaku" class="headerlink" title="PL Champ Chelsea Agree £60M Transfer for Everton Star Romelu Lukaku"></a>PL Champ Chelsea Agree £60M Transfer for Everton Star Romelu Lukaku</h1><p>Chelsea have agreed a £60 million transfer fee with Everton for striker Romelu Lukaku, according to reports.</p>
<p>The Belgium international is expected to undergo a medical in the next few days and sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>Lukaku, 24, scored 25 goals in all competitions for Everton last season, finishing as the Premier League’s top scorer ahead of Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane.</p>
<p>He joined Everton from Chelsea for £28 million in July 2014 and has scored 68 goals in 151 appearances for the Merseyside club.</p>
<h1 id="Manchester-City-Break-British-Transfer-Record-to-Sign-Bernardo-Silva"><a href="#Manchester-City-Break-British-Transfer-Record-to-Sign-Bernardo-Silva" class="headerlink" title="Manchester City Break British Transfer Record to Sign Bernardo Silva"></a>Manchester City Break British Transfer Record to Sign Bernardo Silva</h1><p>Manchester City have broken their British Transfer Record to sign Bernardo Silva from Monaco for £43million.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the club, and is Pep Guardiola’s first signing of the summer.</p>
<p>Silva is a versatile midfielder who can play in any position in the midfield, and he will be a good addition to the Manchester City squad.</p>
<p>He had an excellent season for Monaco last year, scoring ten goals and providing fourteen assists in all competitions.</p>
<p>Bernardo Silva is a very talented player, and he is sure to be a success in the Premier League.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-Splash-Out-£52M-on-Lyon-Star-Alexandre-Lacazette"><a href="#Arsenal-Splash-Out-£52M-on-Lyon-Star-Alexandre-Lacazette" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal Splash Out £52M on Lyon Star Alexandre Lacazette"></a>Arsenal Splash Out £52M on Lyon Star Alexandre Lacazette</h1><p>Arsenal have completed the signing of Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette in a £52M deal, making him the most expensive player in the club’s history.</p>
<p>Lacazette, 26, has signed a five-year contract at the Emirates and is seen as the long-term replacement for Olivier Giroud up front.</p>
<p>The France international scored over 100 goals in 253 appearances for Lyon and was the top scorer in Ligue 1 last season with 28 goals.</p>

Casino Gamomat shares the top 5 tips with you!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Avoid betting on red or black – these are the most popular bets, so the odds aren’t in your favor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to even-money bets like odd/even, high/low, and 1-18/19-36 – these offer better odds than betting on colors or numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use outside bets instead of inside bets – inside bets have worse odds, so stick to outside bets like column or dozen bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet small amounts instead of large ones – this will help you stay in the game longer and give you more chances to win.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch the wheel and bet when there is a favorable pattern – this takes some practice but can be very profitable in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-win-at-Gamomat-roulette-every-time"><a href="#How-to-win-at-Gamomat-roulette-every-time" class="headerlink" title="How to win at Gamomat roulette every time"></a>How to win at Gamomat roulette every time</h1><p>Achievements in life are often determined by the decisions we make and how we respond to the challenges that come our way. For some people, gambling is a means to an end, a way of making easy money. For others, it’s a passionate hobby that can be incredibly rewarding. Whichever camp you may fall into, if you want to win at Gamomat roulette every time, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
<p>The first step is to learn the game inside out. Roulette is a complex game with many different betting options, so it’s important to have a firm understanding of the rules before you start placing bets. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources available online which can help you get up to speed quickly.</p>
<p>Once you’re confident with the game itself, it’s time to start thinking about your betting strategy. In roulette, your chances of winning are basically 50/50 – no matter what bet you place. However, by employing some simple betting techniques, you can tilt the odds in your favour and increase your chances of winning significantly.</p>
<p>One popular approach is called ‘diversification’. This simply means spreading your bets across as many different outcomes as possible. By doing this, even if you lose on one or two bets, you still have a good chance of winning overall.</p>
<p>Another important factor to consider when betting on roulette is the odds offered by different casinos. Not all casinos offer the same odds, so it’s worth doing some research before signing up for an account. The better the odds offered by a casino, the more likely you are to win in the long run.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to always stick to a budget and never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Gambling should be fun and exciting, not stressful or anxiety-inducing. If you follow these tips and play smartly, you can guarantee yourself some big wins at Gamomat roulette every time!</p>
<h1 id="Secrets-of-Beating-Roulette-Casino-Games-–-Gamomat-Method-Revealed"><a href="#Secrets-of-Beating-Roulette-Casino-Games-–-Gamomat-Method-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Secrets of Beating Roulette Casino Games – Gamomat Method Revealed"></a>Secrets of Beating Roulette Casino Games – Gamomat Method Revealed</h1><p>Is there a secret to beating roulette? Some gamblers believe that there is – and they devote considerable time and effort into trying to crack the code. But what if there was an easier way?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there is a method that’s been proven to work time and time again, and it doesn’t involve any guesswork or complex strategies. In fact, all you need is a little bit of luck and some basic knowledge about the game. So what is this infallible technique?</p>
<p>The Gamomat Method.</p>
<p>This approach is based on the theory that casino games are Beatable, as long as you use the right strategy. It involves making small bets on specific numbers and watching the wheel spin; when the ball lands in your chosen number, you collect your winnings.<br>It might not be as exciting as some of the more high-risk strategies out there, but it’s one of the most reliable ways to make money at roulette. And because you’re only betting small amounts, your losses are limited too.</p>
<p>So how do you go about using the Gamomat Method? Here are a few tips:</p>
<p>-Choose a table with low minimum bets. This will give you more chances to win without risking too much money.<br>-Always bet on black or red – this increases your chances of winning by 50%.<br>-Don’t bet on single numbers – the odds are against you this way.<br>-Play European roulette instead of American roulette – the house edge is lower, so you have a better chance of winning.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Cheat-at-Roulette-Casino-Game-–-Gamomat-Version"><a href="#How-to-Cheat-at-Roulette-Casino-Game-–-Gamomat-Version" class="headerlink" title="How to Cheat at Roulette Casino Game – Gamomat Version"></a>How to Cheat at Roulette Casino Game – Gamomat Version</h1><p>If you want to know how to cheat at Roulette casino game – Gamomat Version, then this is the article for you. The first step is to learn the basics of how to play the game. Once you understand the game and how it works, you can start to put into place some simple cheats that will give you an edge over the casino.</p>
<p>The most important thing when trying to cheat at Roulette is to make sure that you do not get caught. If the casino suspects that you are cheating, they will ask you to leave and may even ban you from playing at their establishment in the future. So always be aware of your surroundings and take precautions not to get caught.</p>
<p>Now that we have that out of the way, let’s take a look at some of the ways that you can cheat at Roulette casino game – Gamomat Version.</p>
<p>One way to cheat is by using a betting system. There are many different betting systems that can be used, but one of the most popular is called the Martingale System. With this system, you increase your bet size after every loss until you win, which then allows you to start over with your original bet amount. This system can be used with any type of bet, but it is especially effective when betting on black or red as these are the most common outcomes.</p>
<p>Another way to cheat at Roulette is by using a betting pattern. This involves placing bets on certain numbers or combinations of numbers that seem likely to hit based on past results. There are many different betting patterns that can be used, but some of the most popular include:<br>the High-Low Betting Pattern, the Centre Betting Pattern and the Split Betting Pattern.</p>
<p>You can also use a cheating device such as a roulette computer to help give yourself an edge over the casino. A roulette computer is a small device that attaches to your computer and uses mathematical algorithms to predict where the ball will land on each spin. This gives you an advantage over other players as well as the casino because you know what number is going to come up before anyone else does.</p>
<p>While all of these methods can give you an edge over the casino, it is important to remember that none of them are 100% guaranteed to work every time. So always use caution when trying any of these methods and make sure that you are aware of any possible risks involved.</p>
<h1 id="Winning-Strategies-for-Beating-Roulette-Casino-Gamomat"><a href="#Winning-Strategies-for-Beating-Roulette-Casino-Gamomat" class="headerlink" title="Winning Strategies for Beating Roulette Casino Gamomat"></a>Winning Strategies for Beating Roulette Casino Gamomat</h1><p>There are a number of different ways that you can go about trying to beat the roulette casino game. However, not every strategy is going to work for everyone. You need to find the approach that best suits your playing style and your bankroll.</p>
<p>One strategy that has been proven to be successful for many players is the Martingale system. With this approach, you double your bet after each loss until you win. This system can be risky if you are playing with a small bankroll, as it can quickly eat away at your funds. However, if you have a larger bankroll, it can be a effective way to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Another popular strategy is called the d’Alembert system. This approach is a bit more conservative than the Martingale system, and involves increasing your bet by one unit after each win and decreasing it by one unit after each loss. This system is less risky than the Martingale system, but it also has a lower potential return.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also plenty of other betting systems that you can try in order to beat roulette casino games. But none of these systems will work unless you are comfortable with them and are able to stick to them consistently. So before attempting any of these strategies, be sure to practice them thoroughly in free play mode so that you know what to expect when you start betting real money.</p>

For some people, the lure of potentially winning big is too strong to resist, while others are more hesitant to gamble out of fear of losing money. If you’re looking to increase your chances of winning while gambling in a casino, here are some key tips to follow:</p>
<p>Pick the right games: Not all casino games are created equal – some offer better odds than others. When picking a game to gamble on, choose one that has favourable odds for you. For example, blackjack or baccarat have better odds than slot machines.</p>
<p>Play within your budget: It’s important not to gamble more money than you can afford to lose. Decide beforehand how much money you’re willing to stake on each game and stick to it. This will help reduce the risk of losing too much money if you happen to lose.</p>
<p>Spread your bets: Another way to minimise your risk when gambling is to spread your bets across different games. This way, if you lose on one game, you still have other games left in which you can make a profit.</p>
<p> practice makes perfect: One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning while gambling in casino Panathinaikos is by practicing first. Play simulated games or watch tutorials online so you understand the rules and strategies involved in each game before playing for real money.</p>

<p>Choose the right games: Not all casino games are created equal – some offer substantially better odds than others. If you’re looking to increase your chances of winning, choose games like blackjack, craps, and baccarat instead of slots or roulette.</p>
<p>Play smart: Just as importantly as choosing the right games is playing them intelligently. Don’t throw away your money by betting on high-risk bets; stick to conservative strategies and only bet what you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Know the house edge: Every casino game has a “house edge” – the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to earn over the long run. When choosing which game to play, be sure to consider the house edge so you can make informed decisions about where to put your money.</p>
<p>Take advantage of bonuses: Many online casinos offer generous bonuses for new players, which can give you a nice head start on your bankroll. Make sure you take full advantage of these promotions before signing up!</p>

<p>First and foremost, it is important to be patient. Many people make the mistake of rushing into things and playing machines recklessly in the hopes of hitting the jackpot. This is not a recommended strategy, as it can lead to lose money very quickly. Instead, take your time and figure out which machines are most likely to pay out and which ones offer the best odds.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind when gaming at casino Panathinaikos is that it is important to set a budget and stick to it. This means knowing how much money you are willing to lose and not gambling any more than that amount. It can be tempting to keep playing after losing a lot of money, but this is ultimately a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Finally, always make sure you are aware of the rules and regulations governing the particular type of game you are playing. There are many different variants of slot machines, for example, so it is important to know what type you are playing before starting. By knowing the rules, you can make sure you are making the most advantageous bets possible.</p>
